## Description
TRIVIA CHALLENGER is a trivia game where players race against the clock to correctly answer as many trivia questions as possible. After entering your name, the game begins a 60 second or 1 minute countdown. You can then select the category and difficulty of each of your upcoming questions. The number of points you earn or lose depends on the question difficulty and answer correctness. Questions of higher difficulty will be worth more and questions of lower difficulty will be worth less (Easy: 10 pts, Medium: 30 pts, Hard: 50 pts). If a question is answered correctly, you will receive the number of points the question was worth. If a question is answered incorrectly, that same number of points will be deducted from your score. Your final score will be the number of points you have at the end when the timer reaches zero. Your rank and the current reigning champions are also displayed at the end. This final project is meant to serve as both a form of entertainment and education. The player will have fun challenging themselves to improve their rank and defeat the current reigning champions. At the same, they will be learning many interesting facts as they answer the trivia questions.
